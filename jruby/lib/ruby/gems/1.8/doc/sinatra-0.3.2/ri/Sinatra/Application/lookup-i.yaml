- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Visits and invokes each handler registered for the <tt>request_method</tt>
    in definition order until a Result response is produced. If no handler responds
    with a Result, the NotFound error handler is invoked.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: When the request_method is &quot;HEAD&quot; and no valid Result is produced
    by the set of handlers registered for HEAD requests, an attempt is made to invoke
    the GET handlers to generate the response before resorting to the default error
    handler.
