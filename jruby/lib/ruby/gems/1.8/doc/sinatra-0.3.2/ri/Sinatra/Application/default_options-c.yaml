  body: 'Hash of default application configuration options. When a new Application
    is created, the #options object takes its initial values from here.'

  body: Changes to the default_options Hash effect only Application objects created
    after the changes are made. For this reason, modifications to the default_options
    Hash typically occur at the very beginning of a file, before any DSL related functions
    are invoked.
