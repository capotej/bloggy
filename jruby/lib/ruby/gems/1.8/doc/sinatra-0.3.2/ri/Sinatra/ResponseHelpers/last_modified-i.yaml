- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Set the last modified time of the resource (HTTP 'Last-Modified' header) and
    halt if conditional GET matches. The <tt>time</tt> argument is a Time, DateTime,
    or other object that responds to <tt>to_time</tt>.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: When the current request includes an 'If-Modified-Since' header that matches
    the time specified, execution is immediately halted with a '304 Not Modified'
    response.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Calling this method before perfoming heavy processing (e.g., lengthy database
    queries, template rendering, complex logic) can dramatically increase overall
    throughput with caching clients.
