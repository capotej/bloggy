- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Is called <em>after</em> <tt>Base.save</tt> (regardless of whether it's a
    <tt>create</tt> or <tt>update</tt> save). Note that this callback is still wrapped
    in the transaction around <tt>save</tt>. For example, if you invoke an external
    indexer at this point it won't see the changes in the database.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: " class Contact &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n   after_save { logger.info( 'New \
    contact saved!' ) }\n end\n"
