  body: 'Check-out a database connection from the pool, indicating that you want to
    use it. You should call #checkin when you no longer need this.'

  body: 'This is done by either returning an existing connection, or by creating a
    new connection. If the maximum number of connections for this pool has already
    been reached, but the pool is empty (i.e. they''re all being used), then this
    method will wait until a thread has checked in a connection. The wait time is
    bounded however: if no connection can be checked out within the timeout specified
    for this pool, then a ConnectionTimeoutError exception will be raised.'
