- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Checks whether a record exists in the database that matches conditions given.
    These conditions can either be a single integer representing a primary key id
    to be found, or a condition to be matched like using ActiveRecord#find.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The <tt>id_or_conditions</tt> parameter can be an Integer or a String if you
    want to search the primary key column of the table for a matching id, or if you're
    looking to match against a condition you can use an Array or a Hash.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'Possible gotcha: You can''t pass in a condition as a string e.g. &quot;name
    = ''Jamie''&quot;, this would be sanitized and then queried against the primary
    key column as &quot;id = ''name = \''Jamie&quot;'
