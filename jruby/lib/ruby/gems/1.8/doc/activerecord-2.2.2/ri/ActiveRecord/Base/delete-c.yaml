- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Delete an object (or multiple objects) where the <tt>id</tt> given matches
    the primary_key. A SQL <tt>DELETE</tt> command is executed on the database which
    means that no callbacks are fired off running this. This is an efficient method
    of deleting records that don't need cleaning up after or other actions to be taken.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Objects are <em>not</em> instantiated with this method, and so +:dependent+
    rules defined on associations are not honered.
