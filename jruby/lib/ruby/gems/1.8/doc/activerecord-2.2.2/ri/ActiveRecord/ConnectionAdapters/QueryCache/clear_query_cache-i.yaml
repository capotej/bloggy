- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: One reason you may wish to call this method explicitly is between queries
    that ask the database to randomize results. Otherwise the cache would see the
    same SQL query and repeatedly return the same result each time, silently undermining
    the randomness you were expecting.
