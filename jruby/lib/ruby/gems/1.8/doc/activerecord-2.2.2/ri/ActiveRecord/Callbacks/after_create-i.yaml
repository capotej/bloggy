  body: Is called <em>after</em> <tt>Base.save</tt> on new objects that haven't been
    saved yet (no record exists). Note that this callback is still wrapped in the
    transaction around <tt>save</tt>. For example, if you invoke an external indexer
    at this point it won't see the changes in the database.
