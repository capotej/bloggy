  body: New objects can be instantiated as either empty (pass no construction parameter)
    or pre-set with attributes but not yet saved (pass a hash with key names matching
    the associated table column names). In both instances, valid attribute keys are
    determined by the column names of the associated table -- hence you can't have
    attributes that aren't part of the table columns.
