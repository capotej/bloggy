- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: ConnectionHandler is a collection of ConnectionPool objects. It is used for
    keeping separate connection pools for ActiveRecord models that connect to different
    databases.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'For example, suppose that you have 5 models, with the following hierarchy:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: " |\n +-- Book\n |    |\n |    +-- ScaryBook\n |    +-- GoodBook\n +-- Author\n\
    \ +-- BankAccount\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Suppose that Book is to connect to a separate database (i.e. one other than
    the default database). Then Book, ScaryBook and GoodBook will all use the same
    connection pool. Likewise, Author and BankAccount will use the same connection
    pool. However, the connection pool used by Author/BankAccount is not the same
    as the one used by Book/ScaryBook/GoodBook.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Normally there is only a single ConnectionHandler instance, accessible via
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection_handler. ActiveRecord models use this to determine
    that connection pool that they should use.
