- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Specifies a one-to-one association with another class. This method should
    only be used if this class contains the foreign key. If the other class contains
    the foreign key, then you should use <tt>has_one</tt> instead. See also ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods's
    overview on when to use <tt>has_one</tt> and when to use <tt>belongs_to</tt>.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'Methods will be added for retrieval and query for a single associated object,
    for which this object holds an id:'
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  type: :LABELED
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: Returns the associated object. <tt>nil</tt> is returned if none is found.
    label: association(force_reload = false)
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: Assigns the associate object, extracts the primary key, and sets it as the
      foreign key.
    label: association=(associate)
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: Returns <tt>true</tt> if there is no associated object.
    label: association.nil?
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated with
      <tt>attributes</tt> and linked to this object through a foreign key, but has
      not yet been saved.
    label: build_association(attributes = {})
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated with
      <tt>attributes</tt>, linked to this object through a foreign key, and that has
      already been saved (if it passed the validation).
    label: create_association(attributes = {})
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: (<tt>association</tt> is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument,
    so <tt>belongs_to :author</tt> would add among others <tt>author.nil?</tt>.)

    body: <tt>Post#author</tt> (similar to <tt>Author.find(author_id)</tt>)
    label: '*'
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: <tt>Post#author=(author)</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author_id = author.id</tt>)
    label: '*'
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: <tt>Post#author?</tt> (similar to <tt>post.author == some_author</tt>)
    label: '*'
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: <tt>Post#author.nil?</tt>
    label: '*'
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI

      post.author</tt>)
    label: '*'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the behavior
    of the association.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::H 
  text: Options
  level: 3
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  type: :LABELED
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't
      be inferred from the association name. So <tt>has_one :author</tt> will by default
      be linked to the Author class, but if the real class name is Person, you'll
      have to specify it with this option.
    label: ":class_name"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: Specify the conditions that the associated object must meet in order to
      be included as a <tt>WHERE</tt> SQL fragment, such as <tt>authorized = 1</tt>.
    label: ":conditions"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: By default, this is <tt>*</tt> as in <tt>SELECT * FROM</tt>, but can be
      changed if, for example, you want to do a join but not include the joined columns.
      Do not forget to include the primary and foreign keys, otherwise it will raise
      an error.
    label: ":select"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed
      to be the name of the association with an &quot;_id&quot; suffix. So a class
      that defines a <tt>belongs_to :person</tt> association will use &quot;person_id&quot;
      as the default <tt>:foreign_key</tt>. Similarly, <tt>belongs_to :favorite_person,
      :class_name =&gt; &quot;Person&quot;</tt> will use a foreign key of &quot;favorite_person_id&quot;.
    label: ":foreign_key"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: If set to <tt>:destroy</tt>, the associated object is destroyed when this
      object is. If set to <tt>:delete</tt>, the associated object is deleted <b>without</b>
      calling its destroy method. This option should not be specified when <tt>belongs_to</tt>
      is used in conjunction with a <tt>has_many</tt> relationship on another class
      because of the potential to leave orphaned records behind.
    label: ":dependent"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: 'Caches the number of belonging objects on the associate class through the
      use of <tt>increment_counter</tt> and <tt>decrement_counter</tt>. The counter
      cache is incremented when an object of this class is created and decremented
      when it''s destroyed. This requires that a column named <tt>#{table_name}_count</tt>
      (such as <tt>comments_count</tt> for a belonging Comment class) is used on the
      associate class (such as a Post class). You can also specify a custom counter
      cache column by providing a column name instead of a <tt>true</tt>/<tt>false</tt>
      value to this option (e.g., <tt>:counter_cache =&gt; :my_custom_counter</tt>.)
      Note: Specifying a counter cache will add it to that model''s list of readonly
      attributes using <tt>attr_readonly</tt>.'
    label: ":counter_cache"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: Specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when this
      object is loaded.
    label: ":include"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: 'Specify this association is a polymorphic association by passing <tt>true</tt>.
      Note: If you''ve enabled the counter cache, then you may want to add the counter
      cache attribute to the <tt>attr_readonly</tt> list in the associated classes
      (e.g. <tt>class Post; attr_readonly :comments_count; end</tt>).'
    label: ":polymorphic"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: If true, the associated object is readonly through the association.
    label: ":readonly"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: If false, don't validate the associated objects when saving the parent object.
      <tt>false</tt> by default.
    label: ":validate"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'Option examples:'
