  body: Adds an error to the base object instead of any particular attribute. This
    is used to report errors that don't tie to any specific attribute, but rather
    to the object as a whole. These error messages don't get prepended with any field
    name when iterating with <tt>each_full</tt>, so they should be complete sentences.
