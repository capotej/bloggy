  body: 'Returns a clone of the record that hasn''t been assigned an id yet and is
    treated as a new record. Note that this is a &quot;shallow&quot; clone: it copies
    the object''s attributes only, not its associations. The extent of a &quot;deep&quot;
    clone is application-specific and is therefore left to the application to implement
    according to its need.'
