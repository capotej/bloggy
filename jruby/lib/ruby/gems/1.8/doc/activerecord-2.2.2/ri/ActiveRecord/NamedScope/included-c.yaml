  body: 'All subclasses of ActiveRecord::Base have two named \scopes:'
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  type: :BULLET
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: <tt>all</tt> - which is similar to a <tt>find(:all)</tt> query, and
    label: '*'
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: '<tt>scoped</tt> - which allows for the creation of anonymous \scopes, on
      the fly: <tt>Shirt.scoped(:conditions =&gt; {:color =&gt; ''red''}).scoped(:include
      =&gt; :washing_instructions)</tt>'
    label: '*'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: These anonymous \scopes tend to be useful when procedurally generating complex
    queries, where passing intermediate values (scopes) around as first-class objects
    is convenient.
