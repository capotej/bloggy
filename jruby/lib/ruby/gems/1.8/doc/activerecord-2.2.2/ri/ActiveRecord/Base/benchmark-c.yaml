  body: "  Project.benchmark(&quot;Creating project&quot;) do\n    project = Project.create(&quot;name&quot; \
    =&gt; &quot;stuff&quot;)\n    project.create_manager(&quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;David&quot;)\n\

- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The benchmark is only recorded if the current level of the logger is less
    than or equal to the <tt>log_level</tt>, which makes it easy to include benchmarking
    statements in production software that will remain inexpensive because the benchmark
    will only be conducted if the log level is low enough.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The logging of the multiple statements is turned off unless <tt>use_silence</tt>
    is set to false.
