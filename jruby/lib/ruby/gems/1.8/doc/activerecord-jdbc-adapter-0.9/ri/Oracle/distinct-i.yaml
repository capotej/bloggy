- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: SELECT DISTINCT clause for a given set of columns and a given ORDER BY clause.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Oracle requires the ORDER BY columns to be in the SELECT list for DISTINCT
    queries. However, with those columns included in the SELECT DISTINCT list, you
    won't actually get a distinct list of the column you want (presuming the column
    has duplicates with multiple values for the ordered-by columns. So we use the
    FIRST_VALUE function to get a single (first) value for each column, effectively
    making every row the same.
