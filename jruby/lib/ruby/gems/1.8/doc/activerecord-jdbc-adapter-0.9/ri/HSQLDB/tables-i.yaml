  body: override to filter out system tables that otherwise end up in db/schema.rb
    during migrations. JdbcConnection#tables now takes an optional block filter so
    we can screen out rows corresponding to system tables. HSQLDB names its system
    tables SYSTEM.*, but H2 seems to name them without any kind of convention
full_name: "::HSQLDB#tables"
