- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Rack::URLMap takes a hash mapping urls or paths to apps, and dispatches accordingly.
    Support for HTTP/1.1 host names exists if the URLs start with <tt>http://</tt>
    or <tt>https://</tt>.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: URLMap modifies the SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO such that the part relevant
    for dispatch is in the SCRIPT_NAME, and the rest in the PATH_INFO. This should
    be taken care of when you need to reconstruct the URL in order to create links.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: URLMap dispatches in such a way that the longest paths are tried first, since
    they are most specific.
