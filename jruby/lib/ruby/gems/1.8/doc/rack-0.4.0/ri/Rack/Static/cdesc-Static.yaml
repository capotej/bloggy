- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The Rack::Static middleware intercepts requests for static files (javascript
    files, images, stylesheets, etc) based on the url prefixes passed in the options,
    and serves them using a Rack::File object. This allows a Rack stack to serve both
    static and dynamic content.

  body: "    use Rack::Static, :urls =&gt; [&quot;/media&quot;]\n    will serve all \
    requests beginning with /media from the &quot;media&quot; folder\n    located \
    in the current directory (ie media/*).\n\n    use Rack::Static, :urls =&gt; [&quot;/css&quot;, \
    &quot;/images&quot;], :root =&gt; &quot;public&quot;\n    will serve all requests \
    beginning with /css or /images from the folder\n    &quot;public&quot; in the \
    current directory (ie public/css/* and public/images/*)\n"
