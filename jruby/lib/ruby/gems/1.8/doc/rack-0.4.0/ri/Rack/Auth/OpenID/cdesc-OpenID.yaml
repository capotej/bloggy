  body: The ruby-openid home page is at http://openidenabled.com/ruby-openid/.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P

    and http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html. Documentation for
    published OpenID extensions and related topics can be found at http://openid.net/developers/specs/.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: It is recommended to read through the OpenID spec, as well as ruby-openid's
    documentation, to understand what exactly goes on. However a setup as simple as
    the presented examples is enough to provide functionality.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This library strongly intends to utilize the OpenID 2.0 features of the ruby-openid
    library, while maintaining OpenID 1.0 compatiblity.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P

  body: 'NOTE: Extensions are not currently supported by this implimentation of the
    OpenID rack application due to the complexity of the current ruby-openid extension
    handling.'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'NOTE: Due to the amount of data that this library stores in the session,
