- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Support for the Camping micro framework at http://camping.rubyforge.org This
    implements the unusually long Postamble that Camping usually needs and shrinks
    it down to just a single line or two.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'Your Postamble would now be:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Mongrel::Camping::start(&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;,3001,&quot;/tepee&quot;,Tepee).join\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'If you wish to get fancier than this then you can use the Camping::CampingHandler
    directly instead and do your own wiring:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  h = Mongrel::HttpServer.new(server, port)\n  h.register(uri, CampingHandler.new(Tepee))\n\
    \  h.register(&quot;/favicon.ico&quot;, Mongrel::Error404Handler.new(&quot;&quot;))\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: I add the /favicon.ico since camping apps typically don't have them and it's
    just annoying anyway.
