- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Sets up the standard signal handlers that are used on most Ruby It only configures
    if the platform is not win32 and doesn't do a HUP signal since this is typically
    framework specific.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Requires a :pid_file option given to Configurator.new to indicate a file to
    delete. It sets the MongrelConfig.needs_restart attribute if the start command
    should reload. It's up to you to detect this and do whatever is needed for a &quot;restart&quot;.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This command is safely ignored if the platform is win32 (with a warning)
