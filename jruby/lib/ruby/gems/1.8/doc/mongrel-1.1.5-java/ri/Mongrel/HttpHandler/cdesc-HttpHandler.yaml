comment: 
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You implement your application handler with this. It's very light giving just
    the minimum necessary for you to handle a request and shoot back a response. Look
    at the HttpRequest and HttpResponse objects for how to use them.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This is used for very simple handlers that don't require much to operate.
    More extensive plugins or those you intend to distribute as GemPlugins should
    be implemented using the HttpHandlerPlugin mixin.
