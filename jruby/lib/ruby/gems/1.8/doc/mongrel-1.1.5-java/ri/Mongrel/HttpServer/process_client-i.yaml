  body: Does the majority of the IO processing. It has been written in Ruby using
    about 7 different IO processing strategies and no matter how it's done the performance
    just does not improve. It is currently carefully constructed to make sure that
    it gets the best possible performance, but anyone who thinks they can make it
    faster is more than welcome to take a crack at it.
