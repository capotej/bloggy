- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: When a handler is found for a registered URI then this class is constructed
    and passed to your HttpHandler::process method. You should assume that <b>one</b>
    handler processes all requests. Included in the HttpRequest is a HttpRequest.params
    Hash that matches common CGI params, and a HttpRequest.body which is a string
    containing the request body (raw for now).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The HttpRequest.initialize method will convert any request that is larger
    than Const::MAX_BODY into a Tempfile and use that as the body. Otherwise it uses
    a StringIO object. To be safe, you should assume it works like a file.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The HttpHandler.request_notify system is implemented by having HttpRequest
    call HttpHandler.request_begins, HttpHandler.request_progress, HttpHandler.process
    during the IO processing. This adds a small amount of overhead but lets you implement
    finer controlled handlers and filters.
