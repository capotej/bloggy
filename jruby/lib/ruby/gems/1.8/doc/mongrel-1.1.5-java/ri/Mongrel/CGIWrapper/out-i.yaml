- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The dumb thing is people can call header or this or both and in any order.
    So, we just reuse header and then finalize the HttpResponse the right way. Status
    is taken from the various options and converted to what Mongrel needs via the
    CGIWrapper.status function.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: We also prevent Rails from actually doing the final send by adding a second
    parameter &quot;really_final&quot;. Only Mongrel calls this after Rails is done.
    Since this will break other frameworks, it defaults to a different setting for
    rails (false) and (true) for others.
