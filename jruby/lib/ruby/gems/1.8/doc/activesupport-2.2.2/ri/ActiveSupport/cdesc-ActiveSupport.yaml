    body: Limit the set of zones provided by TZInfo to a meaningful subset of 142
      zones.
    label: '*'
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    body: Retrieve and display zones with a friendlier name (e.g., &quot;Eastern Time
      (US &amp; Canada)&quot; instead of &quot;America/New_York&quot;).
    label: '*'

    body: Lazily load TZInfo::Timezone instances only when they're needed.

  body: The version of TZInfo bundled with Active Support only includes the definitions
    necessary to support the zones defined by the TimeZone class. If you need to use
    zones that aren't defined by TimeZone, you'll need to install the TZInfo gem (if
    a recent version of the gem is installed locally, this will be used instead of
    the bundled version.)
