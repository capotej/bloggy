  body: A duck-type assistant method. For example, Active Support extends Date to
    define an acts_like_date? method, and extends Time to define acts_like_time?.
    As a result, we can do &quot;x.acts_like?(:time)&quot; and &quot;x.acts_like?(:date)&quot;
    to do duck-type-safe comparisons, since classes that we want to act like Time
    simply need to define an acts_like_time? method.
