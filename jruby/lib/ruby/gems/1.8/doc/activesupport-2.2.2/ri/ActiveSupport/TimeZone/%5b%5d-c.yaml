  body: Locate a specific time zone object. If the argument is a string, it is interpreted
    to mean the name of the timezone to locate. If it is a numeric value it is either
    the hour offset, or the second offset, of the timezone to find. (The first one
    with that offset will be returned.) Returns <tt>nil</tt> if no such time zone
    is known to the system.
