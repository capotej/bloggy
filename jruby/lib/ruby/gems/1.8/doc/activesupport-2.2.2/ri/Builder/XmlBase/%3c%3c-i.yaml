- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'Append text to the output target without escaping any markup. May be used
    within the markup brackets as:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  builder.p { |x| x &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;br/&gt;HI&quot; }   #=&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HI&lt;/p&gt;\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This is useful when using non-builder enabled software that generates strings.
    Just insert the string directly into the builder without changing the inserted
    markup.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: It is also useful for stacking builder objects. Builders only use <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>
    to append to the target, so by supporting this method/operation builders can use
    other builders as their targets.
