  body: 'For some reason, nil? is sent to the XmlMarkup object. If nil? is not defined
    and method_missing is invoked, some strange kind of recursion happens. Since nil?
    won''t ever be an XML tag, it is pretty safe to define it here. (Note: this is
    an example of cargo cult programming, cf. http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/10/13/cargo_cult_programming).'
