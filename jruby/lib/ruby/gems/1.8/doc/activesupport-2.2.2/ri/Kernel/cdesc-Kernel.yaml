  body: Since Ruby is very dynamic, methods added to the ancestors of BlankSlate <em>after
    BlankSlate is defined</em> will show up in the list of available BlankSlate methods.
    We handle this by defining a hook in the Object and Kernel classes that will hide
    any method defined after BlankSlate has been loaded.
