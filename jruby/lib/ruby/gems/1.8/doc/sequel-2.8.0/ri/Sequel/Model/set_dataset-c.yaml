- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Sets the dataset associated with the Model class. ds can be a Symbol (specifying
    a table name in the current database), or a Dataset. If a dataset is used, the
    model's database is changed to the given dataset. If a symbol is used, a dataset
    is created from the current database with the table name given. Other arguments
    raise an Error.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This sets the model of the the given/created dataset to the current model
    and adds a destroy method to it. It also extends the dataset with the Associations::EagerLoading
    methods, and assigns a transform to it if there is one associated with the model.
    Finally, it attempts to determine the database schema based on the given/created
    dataset.
