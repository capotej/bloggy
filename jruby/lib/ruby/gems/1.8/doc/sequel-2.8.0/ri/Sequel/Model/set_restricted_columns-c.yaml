- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Set the columns to restrict in new/set/update. Using this means that any columns
    listed here will not be modified. If you have any virtual setter methods (methods
    that end in =) that you want not to be used in new/set/update, they need to be
    listed here as well (without the =).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: It may be better to use (set|update)_except instead of this in places where
    only certain columns may be allowed.
