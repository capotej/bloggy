- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This module includes other Sequel::SQL::*Methods modules and is included in
    other classes that are could be either booleans, strings, or numbers. It also
    adds three methods so that can specify behavior in case one of the operator methods
    has been overridden (such as Symbol#/).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'For example, if Symbol#/ is overridden to produce a string (for example,
    to make file system path creation easier), the following code will not do what
    you want:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  :price/10 &gt; 100\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'In that case, you need to do the following:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  :price.sql_number/10 &gt; 100\n"
