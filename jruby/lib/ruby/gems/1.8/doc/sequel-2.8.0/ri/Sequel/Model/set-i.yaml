- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Updates the instance with the supplied values with support for virtual attributes,
    raising an exception if a value is used that doesn't have a setter method (or
    ignoring it if strict_param_setting = false). Does not save the record.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If no columns have been set for this model (very unlikely), assume symbol
    keys are valid column names, and assign the column value based on that.
