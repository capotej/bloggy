  body: Blob is used to represent binary data in the Ruby environment that is stored
    as a blob type in the database. In PostgreSQL, the blob type is called bytea.
    Sequel represents binary data as a Blob object because certain database engines,
    such as PostgreSQL, require binary data to be escaped.
