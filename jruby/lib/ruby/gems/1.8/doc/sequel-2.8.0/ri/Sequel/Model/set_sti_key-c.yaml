- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Makes this model a polymorphic model with the given key being a string field
    in the database holding the name of the class to use. If the key given has a NULL
    value or there are any problems looking up the class, uses the current class.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This should be used to set up single table inheritance for the model, and
    it only makes sense to use this in the parent class.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You should call sti_key after any calls to set_dataset in the model, otherwise
    subclasses might not have the filters set up correctly.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The filters that sti_key sets up in subclasses will not work if those subclasses
    have further subclasses. For those middle subclasses, you will need to call set_dataset
    manually with the correct filter set.
