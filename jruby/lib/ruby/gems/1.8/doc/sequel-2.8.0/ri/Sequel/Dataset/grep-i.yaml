  body: Pattern match any of the columns to any of the terms. The terms can be strings
    (which use LIKE) or regular expressions (which are only supported in some databases).
    See Sequel::SQL::StringExpression.like. Note that the total number of pattern
    matches will be cols.length * terms.length, which could cause performance issues.
