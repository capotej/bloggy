  body: Sets the value attributes without saving the record. Returns the values changed.
    Raises an error if the keys are not symbols or strings or a string key was passed
    that was not a valid column. This is a low level method that does not respect
    virtual attributes. It should probably be avoided. Look into using set instead.
