  body: Returns the columns in the result set in their true order. If the columns
    are currently cached, returns the cached value. Otherwise, a SELECT query is performed
    to get a single row. Adapters are expected to fill the columns cache with the
    column information when a query is performed. If the dataset does not have any
    rows, this will be an empty array. If you are looking for all columns for a single
    table, see Schema::SQL#schema.
