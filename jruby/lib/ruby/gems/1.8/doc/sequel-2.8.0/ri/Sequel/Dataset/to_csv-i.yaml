- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Returns a string in CSV format containing the dataset records. By default
    the CSV representation includes the column titles in the first line. You can turn
    that off by passing false as the include_column_titles argument.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This does not use a CSV library or handle quoting of values in any way. If
    any values in any of the rows could include commas or line endings, you probably
    shouldn't use this.
