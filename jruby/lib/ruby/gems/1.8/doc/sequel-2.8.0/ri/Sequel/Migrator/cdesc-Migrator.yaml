  body: 'The Migrator module performs migrations based on migration files in a specified
    directory. The migration files should be named using the following pattern (in
    similar fashion to ActiveRecord migrations):'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  &lt;version&gt;_&lt;title&gt;.rb\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'For example, the following files are considered migration files:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  001_create_sessions.rb\n  002_add_data_column.rb\n  ...\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The migration files should contain one or more migration classes based on
    Sequel::Migration.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Migrations are generally run via the sequel command line tool, using the -m
    and -M switches. The -m switch specifies the migration directory, and the -M switch
    specifies the version to which to migrate.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'You can apply migrations using the Migrator API, as well (this is necessary
    if you want to specify the version from which to migrate in addition to the version
    to which to migrate). To apply a migration, the #apply method must be invoked
    with the database instance, the directory of migration files and the target version.
    If no current version is supplied, it is read from the database. The migrator
    automatically creates a schema_info table in the database to keep track of the
    current migration version. If no migration version is stored in the database,
    the version is considered to be 0. If no target version is specified, the database
    is migrated to the latest version available in the migration directory.'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'For example, to migrate the database to the latest version:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Sequel::Migrator.apply(DB, '.')\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'To migrate the database from version 1 to version 5:'
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Sequel::Migrator.apply(DB, '.', 5, 1)\n"
