# GlassFish required properties
# Since GlassFish users start GlassFish using GlassFish launcher,
# these properties do *not* have to be set here. The GlassFish launcher
# takes care of setting them. 
# If someone does not want to use GlassFish launcher, but start GlassFish
# by directly starting Felix, then this is the place to put all the 
# system properties. Felix reads this file at start up time and calls
# appropriate System.setProperty().
# Properties defined here can be referrred using ${propName} syntax
# in config.properties file.
