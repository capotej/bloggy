# A Web Server Called *Ebb*

Ebb aims to be a small and fast web server specifically for hosting 
dynamic Ruby language web applications. 

It is a binding to [libebb](http://tinyclouds.org/libebb)

## Install

The Ruby binding is available as a Ruby Gem. It can be install by executing

    gem install ebb

If you want SSL support you must install GnuTLS.
Ebb has no other dependencies.

## Running

Use Ebb.start_server()

## Speed

(these stats are out of date)

Because Ebb handles most of the processing in C, it is able to do work
often times more efficiently than other Ruby language web servers.

Ebb-Ruby can handle threaded processing better than the other 'evented' 
servers. This won't be of any benefit to Rails applications because Rails
places a lock around each request that wouldn't allow concurrent processing
anyway. In Merb, for example, Ebb's thread handling will allow Ebb instances
to handle larger loads. [More](http://four.livejournal.com/848525.html)
