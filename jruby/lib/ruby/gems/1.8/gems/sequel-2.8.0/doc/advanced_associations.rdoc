= Advanced Associations

Sequel::Model has the most powerful and flexible associations of any ruby ORM.

  "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof" - Carl Sagan

==Background: Sequel::Model association options

There are a bunch of advanced association options that are available to
handle the other-than-bog-standard cases.  First we'll go over some of
the simpler ones:

All associations take a block that can be used to further filter/modify the
default dataset.  There's also an :eager_block option if you want to use
a different block when eager loading via Dataset#eager. Association blocks are
useful for things like:

  Artist.one_to_many :gold_albums, :class=>:Album do |ds|
    ds.filter(:copies_sold > 500000)
  end

There are a whole bunch of options for changing how the association is eagerly
loaded via Dataset#eager_graph: :graph_block, :graph_conditions,
:graph_only_conditions, :graph_join_type (and :graph_join_table_* ones for
JOINing to the join table in a many_to_many association).

- :graph_join_type - The type of join to do
- :graph_conditions - Additional conditions to put on join (needs to be a
  hash or array of all two pairs).  Automatically assumes unqualified symbols
  as first element of the pair to be columns of the associated model, and
  unqualified symbols of the second element of the pair to be columns of the
  current model.
- :graph_block - A block passed to join_table, allowing you to specify
  conditions other than equality, or to use OR, or set up any arbitrary
  condition.  The block is passed the associated table alias, current model
  alias, and array of previous joins.
- :graph_only_conditions - Use these conditions instead of the standard
  association conditions. This is necessary when the standard keys it uses are
  not correct for the association (such as an association that doesn't use
  primary keys).  You can also use this to have a JOIN USING (array of
  symbols), or a NATURAL or CROSS JOIN (nil, with the appropriate
  :graph_join_type).
  
These can be used like this:

  # Makes Artist.eager_graph(:required_albums).all not return artists that
  # don't have any albums
  Artist.one_to_many :required_albums, :class=>:Album, :graph_join_type=>:inner
  
  # Makes sure all returned albums have the active flag set
  Artist.one_to_many :active_albums, :class=>:Album, \
    :graph_conditions=>{:active=>true}
    
  # Only returns albums that have sold more than 500,000 copies
  Artist.one_to_many :gold_albums, :class=>:Album, \
    :graph_block=>proc{|j,lj,js| :copies_sold.qualify(j) > 500000}
    
  # Handles the case where the artist is associated to the album by an
  # artist_name column in the albums table, when name is not the primary key
  # of the artists table
  Artist.one_to_many :albums, :key=>:artist_name, \
    :graph_only_conditions=>{:artist_name=>:name}
    
  # Handles the above case, but where :artist_name is used in both tables,
  # via a JOIN USING
  Artist.one_to_many :albums, :key=>:artist_name, :graph_only_conditions=>[:artist_name]
  
  # Handles the case where all columns in both tables are uniquely named, except
  # for the ones that handle associations
  Artist.one_to_many :albums, :key=>:artist_name, :graph_only_conditions=>nil, \
    :graph_join_type=>:natural

Remember, using #eager_graph is generally only necessary when you need to
filter/order based on columns in an associated table, it is recommended to
use #eager for eager loading if possible.

For lazy loading (e.g. Model[1].association), the :dataset option can be used
to specify an arbitrary dataset (one that uses different keys, multiple keys,
joins to other tables, etc.).

For eager loading via #eager, the :eager_loader option can be used to specify
how to eagerly load a complex association.  This is an extremely powerful
option.  Though it can often be verbose (compared to other things in Sequel),
it allows you complete control over how to eagerly load associations for a
group of objects.

:eager_loader should be a proc that takes 3 arguments, a key_hash,
an array of records, and a hash of dependent associations.  Since you
are given all of the records, you can do things like filter on
associations that are specified by multiple keys, or do multiple
queries depending on the content of the records (which would be
necessary for polymorphic associations).  Inside the :eager_loader
proc, you should get the related objects and populate the
associations for all objects in the array of records.  The hash
of dependent associations is available for you to cascade the eager
loading down multiple levels, but it is up to you to use it.  The
key_hash is a performance enhancement that is used by the default
code and is also available to you.  It is a hash with keys being
foreign/primary key symbols in the current table, and the values
being hashes where the key is foreign/primary key values and values
being arrays of current model objects having the foreign/primary key
value associated with the key.  This is hard to visualize, so I'll
give an example:
    
  album1 = Album.load(:id=>1, :artist_id=>2)
  album2 = Album.load(:id=>3, :artist_id=>2)
  Album.many_to_one :artist
  Album.one_to_many :tracks
  Album.eager(:band, :tracks).all
  # The key_hash provided to the :eager_loader proc would be:
  {:id=>{1=>[album1], 3=>[album2]}, :artist_id=>{2=>[album1, album2]}}

Using these options, you can build associations Sequel doesn't natively support,
and still be able to use the same eager loading features that you are used to.

==ActiveRecord associations

Sequel supports all of associations that ActiveRecord supports, one way or
another.  Sometimes this requires more code, as Sequel is a toolkit and not
a swiss army chainsaw.

===Association callbacks

Sequel supports the same callbacks that ActiveRecord does: :before_add,
:before_remove, :after_add, and :after_remove. It also supports a
callback that ActiveRecord does not, :after_load, which is called
after the association has been loaded (when lazy loading).

Each of these options can be a Symbol specifying an instance method
that takes one argument (the associated object), or a Proc that takes
two arguments (the current object and the associated object), or an
array of Symbols and Procs.  For :after_load with a *_to_many association,
the associated object argument is an array of associated objects.

If any of the before callbacks return false, the adding/removing
does not happen and it either raises an error (the default), or
returns nil (if raise_on_save_failure is false).

All callbacks are also run on many_to_one associations.  If there
was already an existing object for the association, it calls the
remove callbacks on the existing object and the add callbacks on the
new object.  The remove callback calls are placed around the add
callback calls.

===Association extensions

All associations come with a _dataset method that can be further filtered or
otherwise modified:

  class Author < Sequel::Model
    one_to_many :authorships
  end
  Author.first.authorships_dataset.filter(:number < 10).first
 
You can extend a dataset with a module easily with :extend:

  module FindOrCreate
    def find_or_create(vals)
      first(vals) || @opts[:models][nil].create(vals)
    end
  end
  class Author < Sequel::Model
    one_to_many :authorships, :extend=>FindOrCreate
  end
  Author.first.authorships_dataset.find_or_create(:name=>'Blah', :number=>10)

However, note that the dataset doesn't have any knowledge of the model object
that created it via the association, so if you want to use attributes of the
model object, you'll have to use a closure:

  class Author < Sequel::Model
    one_to_many :authorships, :dataset=>(proc do
      key = pk
      ds = Authorship.filter(:author_id=>key)
      ds.meta_def(:find_or_create_by_name) do |name|
        first(:name=>name) || Authorship.create(:name=>name, :author_id=>key)
      end 
      ds  
    end)
  end
  Author.first.authorships_dataset.find_or_create_by_name('Bob')

You can cheat if you want to:

  module FindOrCreate
    def find_or_create(vals)
      # Exploits the fact that Sequel filters are ruby objects that
      # can be introspected.
      author_id = @opts[:where].args[1]
      first(vals) || \
        @opts[:models][nil].create(vals.merge(:author_id=>author_id))
    end 
  end

===has_many :through associations

many_to_many handles the usual case of a has_many :through with a belongs_to in
the associated model.  It doesn't break on the case where the join table is a
model table, unlike ActiveRecord's has_and_belongs_to_many.

ActiveRecord:

  class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :authorships
    has_many :books, :through => :authorships
  end

  class Authorship < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :author
    belongs_to :book
  end

  @author = Author.find :first
  @author.books

Sequel::Model:

  class Author < Sequel::Model
    one_to_many :authorships
    many_to_many :books, :join_table=>:authorships
  end

  class Authorship < Sequel::Model
    many_to_one :author
    many_to_one :book
  end

  @author = Author.first
  @author.books

If you use an association other than belongs_to in the associated model, things
are a bit more involved:

ActiveRecord:

  class Firm < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :clients
    has_many :invoices, :through => :clients
  end

  class Client < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :firm
    has_many :invoices
  end

  class Invoice < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :client
    has_one :firm, :through => :client
  end

  Firm.find(:first).invoices
  
Sequel::Model:

  class Firm < Sequel::Model
    one_to_many :clients
    one_to_many :invoices, :read_only=>true, \
      :dataset=>proc{Invoice.eager_graph(:client).filter(:client__firm_id=>pk)}, \
      :after_load=>(proc do |firm, invs|
        invs.each do |inv|
          inv.client.associations[:firm] = inv.associations[:firm] = firm
        end
      end), \
      :eager_loader=>(proc do |key_hash, firms, associations|
        id_map = key_hash[Firm.primary_key]
        firms.each{|firm| firm.associations[:invoices] = []} 
        Invoice.eager_graph(:client).filter(:client__firm_id=>id_map.keys).all do |inv|
          id_map[inv.client.firm_id].each do |firm|
            inv.client.associations[:firm] = inv.associations[:firm] = firm
            firm.associations[:invoices] << inv 
          end
        end
      end)
  end 

  class Client < Sequel::Model
    many_to_one :firm
    one_to_many :invoices
  end

  class Invoice < Sequel::Model
    many_to_one :client
    many_to_one :firm, :key=>nil, :read_only=>true, \
      :dataset=>proc{Firm.eager_graph(:clients).filter(:clients__id=>client_id)}, \
      :after_load=>(proc do |inv, firm|
        # Delete the cached associations from firm, because it only has the
        # client with this invoice, instead of all clients of the firm
        inv.associations[:client] = firm.associations.delete(:clients).first
      end), \
      :eager_loader=>(proc do |key_hash, invoices, associations|
        id_map = {}
        invoices.each do |inv|
          inv.associations[:firm] = nil
          inv.associations[:client] = nil
          (id_map[inv.client_id] ||= []) << inv
        end
        Firm.eager_graph(:clients).filter(:clients__id=>id_map.keys).all do |firm|
          # Delete the cached associations from firm, because it only has the
          # clients related the invoices being eagerly loaded, instead of all
          # clients of the firm.
          firm.associations.delete(:clients).each do |client|
            id_map[client.pk].each do |inv|
              inv.associations[:firm] = firm
              inv.associations[:client] = client
            end
          end
        end
      end)
  end
  Firm.find(:first).invoices

It is significantly more code in Sequel Model, but quite a bit of it is setting
the intermediate associate record (the client) and the reciprocal association
in the associations cache for each object, which ActiveRecord won't do for you.
The reason you would want to do this is that then firm.invoices.first.firm or
firm.invoices.first.client doesn't do another query to get the firm/client.

===Polymorphic Associations

Polymorphic associations are really a design flaw, but if you are stuck with
them, Sequel can handle it.

ActiveRecord:

  class Asset < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :attachable, :polymorphic => true
  end

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :assets, :as => :attachable
  end

  class Note < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :assets, :as => :attachable
  end

  @asset.attachable = @post
  @asset.attachable = @note

Sequel::Model:

  class Asset < Sequel::Model
    many_to_one :attachable, :reciprocal=>:assets, \
      :dataset=>(proc do
        klass = attachable_type.constantize
        klass.filter(klass.primary_key=>attachable_id)
      end), \
      :eager_loader=>(proc do |key_hash, assets, associations|
        id_map = {}
        assets.each do |asset|
          asset.associations[:attachable] = nil 
          ((id_map[asset.attachable_type] ||= {})[asset.attachable_id] ||= []) << asset
        end
        id_map.each do |klass_name, id_map|
          klass = klass_name.constantize
          klass.filter(klass.primary_key=>id_map.keys).all do |attach|
            id_map[attach.pk].each do |asset|
              asset.associations[:attachable] = attach
            end
          end
        end
      end)
  
    private

    def _attachable=(attachable)
      self[:attachable_id] = (attachable.pk if attachable)
      self[:attachable_type] = (attachable.class.name if attachable)
    end 
  end 

  class Post < Sequel::Model
    one_to_many :assets, :key=>:attachable_id do |ds|
      ds.filter(:attachable_type=>'Post')
    end 
  
    private

    def _add_asset(asset)
      asset.attachable_id = pk
      asset.attachable_type = 'Post'
      asset.save
    end 
    def _remove_asset(asset)
      asset.attachable_id = nil 
      asset.attachable_type = nil 
      asset.save
    end 
    def _remove_all_assets
      Asset.filter(:attachable_id=>pk, :attachable_type=>'Post')\
        .update(:attachable_id=>nil, :attachable_type=>nil)
    end
  end

  class Note < Sequel::Model
    one_to_many :assets, :key=>:attachable_id do |ds|
      ds.filter(:attachable_type=>'Note')
    end

    private

    def _add_asset(asset)
      asset.attachable_id = pk
      asset.attachable_type = 'Note'
      asset.save
    end
    def _remove_asset(asset)
      asset.attachable_id = nil
      asset.attachable_type = nil
      asset.save
    end
    def _remove_all_assets
      Asset.filter(:attachable_id=>pk, :attachable_type=>'Note')\
        .update(:attachable_id=>nil, :attachable_type=>nil)
    end
  end

  @asset.attachable = @post
  @asset.attachable = @note

==More advanced associations

So far, we've only shown that Sequel::Model has associations as powerful as
ActiveRecord's.  Now we will show how Sequel::Model's associations are more
powerful.

===many_to_one/one_to_many not referencing primary key

Let's say you have two tables, invoices and clients, where each client is
associated with many invoices.  However, instead of using the client's primary
key, the invoice is associated to the client by name (this is bad database
design, but sometimes you have to play with the cards you are dealt).

  class Client < Sequel::Model
    one_to_many :invoices, :reciprocal=>:client, \
      :dataset=>proc{Invoice.filter(:client_name=>name)}, \
      :eager_loader=>(proc do |key_hash, clients, associations|
        id_map = {}
        clients.each do |client|
          id_map[client.name] = client
          client.associations[:invoices] = []
        end
        Invoice.filter(:client_name=>id_map.keys.sort).all do |inv|
          inv.associations[:client] = client = id_map[inv.client_name]
          client.associations[:invoices] << inv 
        end
      end)

    private

    def _add_invoice(invoice)
      invoice.client_name = name
      invoice.save
    end 
    def _remove_invoice(invoice)
      invoice.client_name = nil 
      invoice.save
    end 
    def _remove_all_invoices
      Invoice.filter(:client_name=>name).update(:client_name=>nil)
    end 
  end 

  class Invoice < Sequel::Model
    many_to_one :client, :key=>:client_name, \
      :dataset=>proc{Client.filter(:name=>client_name)}, \
      :eager_loader=>(proc do |key_hash, invoices, associations|
        id_map = key_hash[:client_name]
        invoices.each{|inv| inv.associations[:client] = nil}
        Client.filter(:name=>id_map.keys).all do |client|
          id_map[client.name].each{|inv| inv.associations[:client] = client}
        end
      end)

    private

    def _client=(client)
      self.client_name = (client.name if client)
    end
  end

===Joining on multiple keys

Let's say you have two tables that are associated with each other with multiple
keys.  For example:

  # Both of these models have an album_id, number, and disc_number fields.
  # All FavoriteTracks have an associated track, but not all tracks have an
  # associated favorite track
  
  class Track < Sequel::Model
    many_to_one :favorite_track, \
      :dataset=>(proc do
        FavoriteTrack.filter(:disc_number=>disc_number, :number=>number, :album_id=>album_id)
      end), \
      :eager_loader=>(proc do |key_hash, tracks, associations|
        id_map = {}
        tracks.each do |t|
          t.associations[:favorite_track] = nil
          id_map[[t[:album_id], t[:disc_number], t[:number]]] = t
        end
        FavoriteTrack.filter([:album_id, :disc_number, :number]=>id_map.keys).all do |ft|
          if t = id_map[[ft[:album_id], ft[:disc_number], ft[:number]]]
            t.associations[:favorite_track] = ft
          end
        end
      end)
  end

  class FavoriteTrack < Sequel::Model
    many_to_one :track, \
      :dataset=>(proc do
        Track.filter(:disc_number=>disc_number, :number=>number, :album_id=>album_id)
      end), \
      :eager_loader=>(proc do |key_hash, ftracks, associations|
        id_map = {}
        ftracks.each{|ft| id_map[[ft[:album_id], ft[:disc_number], ft[:number]]] = ft}
        Track.filter([:album_id, :disc_number, :number]=>id_map.keys).all do |t|
          id_map[[t[:album_id], t[:disc_number], t[:number]]].associations[:track] = t
        end
      end)
  end

===Tree - All Ancestors and Descendents

Let's say you want to store a tree relationship in your database, it's pretty
simple:

  class Node < Sequel::Model
    many_to_one :parent
    one_to_many :children, :key=>:parent_id
  end
  
You can easily get a node's parent with node.parent, and a node's children with
node.children.  You can even eager load the relationship up to a certain depth:

  # Eager load three generations of generations of children for a given node 
  Node.filter(:id=>1).eager(:children=>{:children=>:children}).all.first
  # Load parents and grandparents for a group of nodes
  Node.filter(:id < 10).eager(:parent=>:parent).all

What if you want to get all ancestors up to the root node, or all descendents,
without knowing the depth of the tree?

  class Node < Sequel::Model
    many_to_one :ancestors, :eager_loader=>(proc do |key_hash, nodes, associations|
      # Handle cases where the root node has the same parent_id as primary_key
      # and also when it is NULL
      non_root_nodes = nodes.reject do |n| 
        if [nil, n.pk].include?(n.parent_id)
          # Make sure root nodes have their parent association set to nil
          n.associations[:parent] = nil 
          true
        else
          false
        end 
      end 
      unless non_root_nodes.empty?
        id_map = {}
        # Create an map of parent_ids to nodes that have that parent id
        non_root_nodes.each{|n| (id_map[n.parent_id] ||= []) << n}
        # Doesn't cause an infinte loop, because when only the root node
        # is left, this is not called.
        Node.filter(Node.primary_key=>id_map.keys).eager(:ancestors).all do |node|
          # Populate the parent association for each node
          id_map[node.pk].each{|n| n.associations[:parent] = node}
        end 
      end 
    end)
    many_to_one :descendants, :eager_loader=>(proc do |key_hash, nodes, associations|
      id_map = {}
      nodes.each do |n| 
        # Initialize an empty array of child associations for each parent node
        n.associations[:children] = []
        # Populate identity map of nodes
        id_map[n.pk] = n 
      end 
      # Doesn't cause an infinite loop, because the :eager_loader is not called
      # if no records are returned.  Exclude id = parent_id to avoid infinite loop
      # if the root note is one of the returned records and it has parent_id = id
      # instead of parent_id = NULL.
      Node.filter(:parent_id=>id_map.keys).exclude(:id=>:parent_id).eager(:descendants).all do |node|
        # Get the parent from the identity map
        parent = id_map[node.parent_id]
        # Set the child's parent association to the parent 
        node.associations[:parent] = parent
        # Add the child association to the array of children in the parent
        parent.associations[:children] << node
      end 
    end)
  end


===Joining multiple keys to a single key, through a third table

Let's say you have a database, of songs, lyrics, and artists.  Each song
may or may not have a lyric (most songs are instrumental).  The lyric can be
associated to an artist in each of four ways: composer, arranger, vocalist,
or lyricist.  These may all be the same, or they could all be different, and
none of them are required.  The songs table has a lyric_id field to associate
it to the lyric, and the lyric table has four fields to associate it to the
artist (composer_id, arranger_id, vocalist_id, and lyricist_id).

What you want to do is get all songs for a given artist, ordered by the song's
name, with no duplicates?

  class Artist < Sequel::Model
    one_to_many :songs, :order=>:songs__name, \
      :dataset=>proc{Song.select(:songs.*).join(Lyric, :id=>:lyric_id, id=>[:composer_id, :arranger_id, :vocalist_id, :lyricist_id])}, \
      :eager_loader=>(proc do |key_hash, records, associations|
        h = key_hash[:id]
        ids = h.keys
        records.each{|r| r.associations[:songs] = []}
        Song.select(:songs.*, :lyrics__composer_id, :lyrics__arranger_id, :lyrics__vocalist_id, :lyrics__lyricist_id)\
