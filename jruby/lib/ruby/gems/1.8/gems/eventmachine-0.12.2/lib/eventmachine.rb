#-- Select in a library based on a global variable.
# PROVISIONALLY commented out this whole mechanism which selects
# a pure-Ruby EM implementation if the extension is not available.
# I expect this will cause a lot of people's code to break, as it
# exposes misconfigurations and path problems that were masked up
# till now. The reason I'm disabling it is because the pure-Ruby
# code will have problems of its own, and it's not nearly as fast
# anyway. Suggested by a problem report from Moshe Litvin. 05Jun07.
#
# 05Dec07: Re-enabled the pure-ruby mechanism, but without the automatic
# fallback feature that tripped up Moshe Litvin. We shouldn't fail over to
# the pure Ruby version because it's possible that the user intended to
# run the extension but failed to do so because of a compilation or
# similar error. So we require either a global variable or an environment
# string be set in order to select the pure-Ruby version.

# == Introduction
# EventMachine provides a fast, lightweight framework for implementing
# Ruby programs that can use the network to communicate with other
# processes. Using EventMachine, Ruby programmers can easily connect
# to remote servers and act as servers themselves. EventMachine does not
# supplant the Ruby IP libraries. It does provide an alternate technique
# for those applications requiring better performance, scalability,
# and discipline over the behavior of network sockets, than is easily
# obtainable using the built-in libraries, especially in applications
# which are structurally well-suited for the event-driven programming model.
#
# EventMachine provides a perpetual event-loop which your programs can
# start and stop. Within the event loop, TCP network connections are
# initiated and accepted, based on EventMachine methods called by your
# program. You also define callback methods which are called by EventMachine
# when events of interest occur within the event-loop.
#
# User programs will be called back when the following events occur:
# * When the event loop accepts network connections from remote peers
# * When data is received from network connections
# * When connections are closed, either by the local or the remote side
# * When user-defined timers expire
#
# == Usage example
#
# Here's a fully-functional echo server implemented in EventMachine:
# 
#       require 'rubygems'
#       require 'eventmachine'
# 
#       module EchoServer
#         def receive_data data
#           send_data ">>>you sent: #{data}"
#           close_connection if data =~ /quit/i
#         end
#       end
# 
#       EventMachine::run {
#         EventMachine::start_server "192.168.0.100", 8081, EchoServer
#       }
# 
# What's going on here? Well, we have defined the module EchoServer to
# implement the semantics of the echo protocol (more about that shortly).
# The last three lines invoke the event-machine itself, which runs forever
# unless one of your callbacks terminates it. The block that you supply
# to EventMachine::run contains code that runs immediately after the event
# machine is initialized and before it starts looping. This is the place
# to open up a TCP server by specifying the address and port it will listen
# on, together with the module that will process the data.
# 
# Our EchoServer is extremely simple as the echo protocol doesn't require
# much work. Basically you want to send back to the remote peer whatever
# data it sends you. We'll dress it up with a little extra text to make it
# interesting. Also, we'll close the connection in case the received data
# contains the word "quit."
# 
# So what about this module EchoServer? Well, whenever a network connection
# (either a client or a server) starts up, EventMachine instantiates an anonymous
# class, that your module has been mixed into. Exactly one of these class
# instances is created for each connection. Whenever an event occurs on a
# given connection, its corresponding object automatically calls specific
# instance methods which your module may redefine. The code in your module
# always runs in the context of a class instance, so you can create instance
# variables as you wish and they will be carried over to other callbacks
# made on that same connection.
# 
# Looking back up at EchoServer, you can see that we've defined the method
# receive_data which (big surprise) is called whenever data has been received
# from the remote end of the connection. Very simple. We get the data
# (a String object) and can do whatever we wish with it. In this case,
# we use the method send_data to return the received data to the caller,
# with some extra text added in. And if the user sends the word "quit,"
# we'll close the connection with (naturally) close_connection.
# (Notice that closing the connection doesn't terminate the processing loop,
# or change the fact that your echo server is still accepting connections!) 
#
#
# == Questions and Futures
# Would it be useful for EventMachine to incorporate the Observer pattern
# and make use of the corresponding Ruby <tt>observer</tt> package?
# Interesting thought.
#
# 
module EventMachine


	# EventMachine::run initializes and runs an event loop.
	# This method only returns if user-callback code calls stop_event_loop.
	# Use the supplied block to define your clients and servers.
	# The block is called by EventMachine::run immediately after initializing
	# its internal event loop but <i>before</i> running the loop.
	# Therefore this block is the right place to call start_server if you
	# want to accept connections from remote clients.
	#
	# For programs that are structured as servers, it's usually appropriate
	# to start an event loop by calling EventMachine::run, and let it
	# run forever. It's also possible to use EventMachine::run to make a single
	# client-connection to a remote server, process the data flow from that
	# single connection, and then call stop_event_loop to force EventMachine::run
	# to return. Your program will then continue from the point immediately
	# following the call to EventMachine::run.
	#
	# You can of course do both client and servers simultaneously in the same program.
	# One of the strengths of the event-driven programming model is that the
	# handling of network events on many different connections will be interleaved,
	# and scheduled according to the actual events themselves. This maximizes
	# efficiency.
	#
	# === Server usage example
	#
	# See the text at the top of this file for an example of an echo server.
	#
	# === Client usage example
	#
	# See the description of stop_event_loop for an extremely simple client example.

	# Obsoleted the use_threads mechanism.
	# 25Nov06: Added the begin/ensure block. We need to be sure that release_machine
	# gets called even if an exception gets thrown within any of the user code
	# that the event loop runs. The best way to see this is to run a unit
	# test with two functions, each of which calls EventMachine#run and each of
	# which throws something inside of #run. Without the ensure, the second test
	# will start without release_machine being called and will immediately throw
	# a C++ runtime error.

  # EventMachine#add_timer adds a one-shot timer to the event loop.
  # Call it with one or two parameters. The first parameters is a delay-time
  # expressed in <i>seconds</i> (not milliseconds). The second parameter, if
  # present, must be a proc object. If a proc object is not given, then you
  # can also simply pass a block to the method call.
  #
  # EventMachine#add_timer may be called from the block passed to EventMachine#run
  # or from any callback method. It schedules execution of the proc or block
  # passed to add_timer, after the passage of an interval of time equal to
  # <i>at least</i> the number of seconds specified in the first parameter to
  # the call.
  #
  # EventMachine#add_timer is a <i>non-blocking</i> call. Callbacks can and will
  # be called during the interval of time that the timer is in effect.
  # There is no built-in limit to the number of timers that can be outstanding at
  # any given time.
  #
  # === Usage example
  #
  # This example shows how easy timers are to use. Observe that two timers are
  # initiated simultaneously. Also, notice that the event loop will continue
  # to run even after the second timer event is processed, since there was
  # no call to EventMachine#stop_event_loop. There will be no activity, of
  # course, since no network clients or servers are defined. Stop the program
  # with Ctrl-C.

  # EventMachine#add_periodic_timer adds a periodic timer to the event loop.
  # It takes the same parameters as the one-shot timer method, EventMachine#add_timer.
  # This method schedules execution of the given block repeatedly, at intervals
  # of time <i>at least</i> as great as the number of seconds given in the first
  # parameter to the call.
  # 
  # === Usage example
  #
  # The following sample program will write a dollar-sign to stderr every five seconds.
  # (Of course if the program defined network clients and/or servers, they would
  # be doing their work while the periodic timer is counting off.)

  # stop_event_loop may called from within a callback method
  # while EventMachine's processing loop is running.
  # It causes the processing loop to stop executing, which
  # will cause all open connections and accepting servers
  # to be run down and closed. <i>Callbacks for connection-termination
  # will be called</i> as part of the processing of stop_event_loop.
  # (There currently is no option to panic-stop the loop without
  # closing connections.) When all of this processing is complete,
  # the call to EventMachine::run which started the processing loop
  # will return and program flow will resume from the statement
  # following EventMachine::run call.
  #
  # === Usage example
  #
  #  require 'rubygems'

  #
  #  module Redmond
  #  
  #    def post_init
  #      puts "We're sending a dumb HTTP request to the remote peer."

  #      EventMachine::stop_event_loop
  #    end
  #  
  #    def unbind
  #      puts "A connection has terminated."
  #    end
  #  
  #  end
  #  
  #  puts "We're starting the event loop now."
  #  EventMachine::run {
  #    EventMachine::connect "www.microsoft.com", 80, Redmond
  #  }
  #  puts "The event loop has stopped."
  #  
  # This program will produce approximately the following output:
  #
  #  We're starting the event loop now.
  #  We're sending a dumb HTTP request to the remote peer.
  #  We received 1440 bytes from the remote peer.
  #  We're going to stop the event loop now.
  #  A connection has terminated.
  #  The event loop has stopped.
  #
  #
  def EventMachine::stop_event_loop
    EventMachine::stop
  end

  # EventMachine::start_server initiates a TCP server (socket
  # acceptor) on the specified IP address and port.
  # The IP address must be valid on the machine where the program
  # runs, and the process must be privileged enough to listen
  # on the specified port (on Unix-like systems, superuser privileges
  # are usually required to listen on any port lower than 1024).
  # Only one listener may be running on any given address/port
  # combination. start_server will fail if the given address and port
  # are already listening on the machine, either because of a prior call
  # to start_server or some unrelated process running on the machine.
  # If start_server succeeds, the new network listener becomes active
  # immediately and starts accepting connections from remote peers,
  # and these connections generate callback events that are processed
  # by the code specified in the handler parameter to start_server.
  #
  # The optional handler which is passed to start_server is the key
  # to EventMachine's ability to handle particular network protocols.
  # The handler parameter passed to start_server must be a Ruby Module
  # that you must define. When the network server that is started by
  # start_server accepts a new connection, it instantiates a new
  # object of an anonymous class that is inherited from EventMachine::Connection,
  # <i>into which the methods from your handler have been mixed.</i>
  # Your handler module may redefine any of the methods in EventMachine::Connection
  # in order to implement the specific behavior of the network protocol.
  #
  # Callbacks invoked in response to network events <i>always</i> take place
  # within the execution context of the object derived from EventMachine::Connection
  # extended by your handler module. There is one object per connection, and
  # all of the callbacks invoked for a particular connection take the form
  # of instance methods called against the corresponding EventMachine::Connection
  # object. Therefore, you are free to define whatever instance variables you
  # wish, in order to contain the per-connection state required by the network protocol you are
  # implementing.
  #
  # start_server is often called inside the block passed to EventMachine::run,
  # but it can be called from any EventMachine callback. start_server will fail
  # unless the EventMachine event loop is currently running (which is why
  # it's often called in the block suppled to EventMachine::run).
  #
  # You may call start_server any number of times to start up network
  # listeners on different address/port combinations. The servers will
  # all run simultaneously. More interestingly, each individual call to start_server
  # can specify a different handler module and thus implement a different
  # network protocol from all the others.
  #
  # === Usage example
  # Here is an example of a server that counts lines of input from the remote
  # peer and sends back the total number of lines received, after each line.
  # Try the example with more than one client connection opened via telnet,
  # and you will see that the line count increments independently on each
  # of the client connections. Also very important to note, is that the
  # handler for the receive_data function, which our handler redefines, may
  # not assume that the data it receives observes any kind of message boundaries.
  # Also, to use this example, be sure to change the server and port parameters
  # to the start_server call to values appropriate for your environment.

  # EventMachine#connect takes the IP address (or hostname) and

  # of the handler Module. All of the details given in that description
  # apply for connections created with EventMachine#connect.
  #
  # === Usage Example
  #
  # Here's a program which connects to a web server, sends a naive
  # request, parses the HTTP header of the response, and then
  # (antisocially) ends the event loop, which automatically drops the connection
  # (and incidentally calls the connection's unbind method).
  # 
  #  require 'rubygems'
  #  require 'eventmachine'
  #  
  #  module DumbHttpClient
  #  
  #    def post_init
  #      send_data "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: _\r\n\r\n"
  #      @data = ""
  #    end
  #  
  #    def receive_data data
  #      @data << data
  #      if  @data =~ /[\n][\r]*[\n]/m
  #        puts "RECEIVED HTTP HEADER:"
  #        $`.each {|line| puts ">>> #{line}" }
  #  
  #        puts "Now we'll terminate the loop, which will also close the connection"
  #        EventMachine::stop_event_loop
  #      end
  #    end
  #  
  #    def unbind
  #      puts "A connection has terminated"
  #    end
  #  
  #  end # DumbHttpClient
  #  
  #  
  #  EventMachine::run {
  #    EventMachine::connect "www.bayshorenetworks.com", 80, DumbHttpClient
  #  }
  #  puts "The event loop has ended"
  #  
  #
  # There are times when it's more convenient to define a protocol handler
  # as a Class rather than a Module. Here's how to do this:
  #
  #  class MyProtocolHandler < EventMachine::Connection
  #    def initialize *args
  #      super
  #      # whatever else you want to do here
  #    end
  #    
  #    #.......your other class code
  #  end # class MyProtocolHandler
  #
  # If you do this, then an instance of your class will be instantiated to handle
  # every network connection created by your code or accepted by servers that you
  # create. If you redefine #post_init in your protocol-handler class, your
  # #post_init method will be called _inside_ the call to #super that you will
  # make in your #initialize method (if you provide one).
  #
  #--
  # EventMachine::connect initiates a TCP connection to a remote
  # server and sets up event-handling for the connection.
  # It internally creates an object that should not be handled
  # by the caller. HOWEVER, it's often convenient to get the
  # object to set up interfacing to other objects in the system.
  # We return the newly-created anonymous-class object to the caller.
  # It's expected that a considerable amount of code will depend
  # on this behavior, so don't change it.
  #
  # Ok, added support for a user-defined block, 13Apr06.
  # This leads us to an interesting choice because of the
  # presence of the post_init call, which happens in the
  # initialize method of the new object. We call the user's
  # block and pass the new object to it. This is a great
  # way to do protocol-specific initiation. It happens
  # AFTER post_init has been called on the object, which I
  # certainly hope is the right choice.
  # Don't change this lightly, because accepted connections
  # are different from connected ones and we don't want
  # to have them behave differently with respect to post_init
  # if at all possible.

	# EventMachine#open_datagram_socket is for support of UDP-based
	# protocols. Its usage is similar to that of EventMachine#start_server.
	# It takes three parameters: an IP address (which must be valid
	# on the machine which executes the method), a port number,
	# and an optional Module name which will handle the data.
	# This method will create a new UDP (datagram) socket and
	# bind it to the address and port that you specify.
	# The normal callbacks (see EventMachine#start_server) will
	# be called as events of interest occur on the newly-created
	# socket, but there are some differences in how they behave.
	#
	# Connection#receive_data will be called when a datagram packet
	# is received on the socket, but unlike TCP sockets, the message
	# boundaries of the received data will be respected. In other words,
	# if the remote peer sent you a datagram of a particular size,
	# you may rely on Connection#receive_data to give you the
	# exact data in the packet, with the original data length.
	# Also observe that Connection#receive_data may be called with a
	# <i>zero-length</i> data payload, since empty datagrams are permitted
	# in UDP.
	#
	# Connection#send_data is available with UDP packets as with TCP,
	# but there is an important difference. Because UDP communications
	# are <i>connectionless,</i> there is no implicit recipient for the packets you
	# send. Ordinarily you must specify the recipient for each packet you send.
	# However, EventMachine
	# provides for the typical pattern of receiving a UDP datagram
	# from a remote peer, performing some operation, and then sending
	# one or more packets in response to the same remote peer.
	# To support this model easily, just use Connection#send_data
	# in the code that you supply for Connection:receive_data.
	# EventMachine will
	# provide an implicit return address for any messages sent to
	# Connection#send_data within the context of a Connection#receive_data callback,
	# and your response will automatically go to the correct remote peer.
	# (TODO: Example-code needed!)
	#
	# Observe that the port number that you supply to EventMachine#open_datagram_socket
	# may be zero. In this case, EventMachine will create a UDP socket
	# that is bound to an <i>ephemeral</i> (not well-known) port.
	# This is not appropriate for servers that must publish a well-known
	# port to which remote peers may send datagrams. But it can be useful
	# for clients that send datagrams to other servers.
	# If you do this, you will receive any responses from the remote
	# servers through the normal Connection#receive_data callback.
	# Observe that you will probably have issues with firewalls blocking
	# the ephemeral port numbers, so this technique is most appropriate for LANs.
	# (TODO: Need an example!)
	#
	# If you wish to send datagrams to arbitrary remote peers (not
	# necessarily ones that have sent data to which you are responding),
	# then see Connection#send_datagram.
	#
	# DO NOT call send_data from a datagram socket
	# outside of a #receive_data method. Use #send_datagram. If you do use #send_data
	# outside of a #receive_data method, you'll get a confusing error
	# because there is no "peer," as #send_data requires. (Inside of #receive_data,
	# #send_data "fakes" the peer as described above.)

	# The action of #defer is to take the block specified in the first parameter (the "operation")
	# and schedule it for asynchronous execution on an internal thread pool maintained by EventMachine.
	# When the operation completes, it will pass the result computed by the block (if any)
	# back to the EventMachine reactor. Then, EventMachine calls the block specified in the
	# second parameter to #defer (the "callback"), as part of its normal, synchronous
	# event handling loop. The result computed by the operation block is passed as a parameter
	# to the callback. You may omit the callback parameter if you don't need to execute any code
	# after the operation completes.
	#
	# <i>Caveats:</i>
	# Note carefully that the code in your deferred operation will be executed on a separate
	# thread from the main EventMachine processing and all other Ruby threads that may exist in
	# your program. Also, multiple deferred operations may be running at once! Therefore, you

	# Don't write a deferred operation that will block forever. If so, the current implementation will
	# not detect the problem, and the thread will never be returned to the pool. EventMachine limits

	# EventMachine::Connection#post_init is called by the event loop

	# and before resumption of the network loop.
	# This method is generally not called by user code, but is called automatically
	# by the event loop. The base-class implementation is a no-op.

	# EventMachine::Connection#receive_data is called by the event loop
	# whenever data has been received by the network connection.
	# It is never called by user code.
	# receive_data is called with a single parameter, a String containing
	# the network protocol data, which may of course be binary. You will
	# generally redefine this method to perform your own processing of the incoming data.
	#
	# Here's a key point which is essential to understanding the event-driven
	# programming model: <i>EventMachine knows absolutely nothing about the protocol
	# which your code implements.</i> You must not make any assumptions about
	# the size of the incoming data packets, or about their alignment on any
	# particular intra-message or PDU boundaries (such as line breaks).
	# receive_data can and will send you arbitrary chunks of data, with the
	# only guarantee being that the data is presented to your code in the order
	# it was collected from the network. Don't even assume that the chunks of
	# data will correspond to network packets, as EventMachine can and will coalesce
	# several incoming packets into one, to improve performance. The implication for your
	# code is that you generally will need to implement some kind of a state machine
	# in your redefined implementation of receive_data. For a better understanding
	# of this, read through the examples of specific protocol handlers given
	# elsewhere in this package. (STUB, WE MUST ADD THESE!)
	#
	# The base-class implementation of receive_data (which will be invoked if
	# you don't redefine it) simply prints the size of each incoming data packet
	# to stdout.

	# EventMachine::Connection#unbind is called by the framework whenever a connection
	# (either a server or client connection) is closed. The close can occur because
	# your code intentionally closes it (see close_connection and close_connection_after_writing),
	# because the remote peer closed the connection, or because of a network error.
	# You may not assume that the network connection is still open and able to send or
	# receive data when the callback to unbind is made. This is intended only to give
	# you a chance to clean up associations your code may have made to the connection
	# object while it was open.
	#
	def unbind
	end

	# EventMachine::Connection#close_connection is called only by user code, and never
	# by the event loop. You may call this method against a connection object in any
	# callback handler, whether or not the callback was made against the connection
	# you want to close. close_connection <i>schedules</i> the connection to be closed
	# at the next available opportunity within the event loop. You may not assume that
	# the connection is closed when close_connection returns. In particular, the framework
	# will callback the unbind method for the particular connection at a point shortly
	# after you call close_connection. You may assume that the unbind callback will
	# take place sometime after your call to close_connection completes. In other words,
	# the unbind callback will not re-enter your code "inside" of your call to close_connection.
	# However, it's not guaranteed that a future version of EventMachine will not change
	# this behavior.
	#
	# close_connection will <i>silently discard</i> any outbound data which you have
	# sent to the connection using EventMachine::Connection#send_data but which has not
	# yet been sent across the network. If you want to avoid this behavior, use
	# EventMachine::Connection#close_connection_after_writing.

	# EventMachine::Connection#close_connection_after_writing is a variant of close_connection.
	# All of the descriptive comments given for close_connection also apply to
	# close_connection_after_writing, <i>with one exception:</i> If the connection has
	# outbound data sent using send_dat but which has not yet been sent across the network,
	# close_connection_after_writing will schedule the connection to be closed <i>after</i>
	# all of the outbound data has been safely written to the remote peer.
	#
	# Depending on the amount of outgoing data and the speed of the network,
	# considerable time may elapse between your call to close_connection_after_writing
	# and the actual closing of the socket (at which time the unbind callback will be called
	# by the event loop). During this time, you <i>may not</i> call send_data to transmit
	# additional data (that is, the connection is closed for further writes). In very
	# rare cases, you may experience a receive_data callback after your call to close_connection_after_writing,
	# depending on whether incoming data was in the process of being received on the connection
	# at the moment when you called close_connection_after_writing. Your protocol handler must
	# be prepared to properly deal with such data (probably by ignoring it).

	# EventMachine::Connection#send_data is only called by user code, never by

	# send_data is an instance method of an object derived from EventMachine::Connection
	# and containing your mixed-in handler code), so if you call it without qualification
	# within a callback function, the data will be sent to the same network connection
	# that generated the callback. Calling self.send_data is exactly equivalent.
	#
	# You can also call send_data to write to a connection <i>other than the one
	# whose callback you are calling send_data from.</i> This is done by recording
	# the value of the connection in any callback function (the value self), in any
	# variable visible to other callback invocations on the same or different

	# send_datagram is for sending UDP messages.

	# However, you may not send an arbitrarily-large data packet because
	# your operating system will enforce a platform-specific limit on

	# packet: some will send a truncated packet, some will complain, and
	# some will silently drop your request).

	# size (typically about 1400 bytes). Some very restrictive WANs
