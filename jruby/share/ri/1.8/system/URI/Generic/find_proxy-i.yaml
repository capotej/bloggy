- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: returns a proxy URI. The proxy URI is obtained from environment variables such as http_proxy, ftp_proxy, no_proxy, etc. If there is no proper proxy, nil is returned.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Note that capitalized variables (HTTP_PROXY, FTP_PROXY, NO_PROXY, etc.) are examined too.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "But http_proxy and HTTP_PROXY is treated specially under CGI environment. It's because HTTP_PROXY may be set by Proxy: header. So HTTP_PROXY is not used. http_proxy is not used too if the variable is case insensitive. CGI_HTTP_PROXY can be used instead."
