  body: Peek at the <tt>depth</tt> event in the stack. The first element on the stack is at depth 0. If <tt>depth</tt> is -1, will parse to the end of the input stream and return the last event, which is always :end_document. Be aware that this causes the stream to be parsed up to the <tt>depth</tt> event, so you can effectively pre-parse the entire document (pull the entire thing into memory) using this method.
