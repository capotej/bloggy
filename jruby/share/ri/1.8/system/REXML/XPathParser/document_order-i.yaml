- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "FIXME: I need to get rid of this, but the issue is that most of the XPath interpreter functions as a filter, which means that we lose context going in and out of function calls. If I knew what the index of the nodes was, I wouldn't have to do this. Maybe add a document IDX for each node? Problems with mutable documents. Or, rewrite everything."
