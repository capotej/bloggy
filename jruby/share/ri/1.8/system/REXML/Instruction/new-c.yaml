If an Instruction, then the Instruction is shallowly cloned (target and content are copied). If a Source, then the source is scanned and parsed for an Instruction declaration. @param content Must be either a String, or a Parent. Can only be a Parent if the target argument is a Source. Otherwise, this String is set as the content of this instruction.
