comment: 
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Parses <tt>date</tt> using Date._parse and converts it to a Time object.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "If a block is given, the year described in <tt>date</tt> is converted by the block. For example:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "    Time.parse(...) {|y| y &lt; 100 ? (y &gt;= 69 ? y + 1900 : y + 2000) : y}\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "If the upper components of the given time are broken or missing, they are supplied with those of <tt>now</tt>. For the lower components, the minimum values (1 or 0) are assumed if broken or missing. For example:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "    # Suppose it is &quot;Thu Nov 29 14:33:20 GMT 2001&quot; now and\n    # your timezone is GMT:\n    Time.parse(&quot;16:30&quot;)     #=&gt; Thu Nov 29 16:30:00 GMT 2001\n    Time.parse(&quot;7/23&quot;)      #=&gt; Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 GMT 2001\n    Time.parse(&quot;Aug 31&quot;)    #=&gt; Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 GMT 2001\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Since there are numerous conflicts among locally defined timezone abbreviations all over the world, this method is not made to understand all of them. For example, the abbreviation &quot;CST&quot; is used variously as:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "    -06:00 in America/Chicago,\n    -05:00 in America/Havana,\n    +08:00 in Asia/Harbin,\n    +09:30 in Australia/Darwin,\n    +10:30 in Australia/Adelaide,\n    etc.\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Based on the fact, this method only understands the timezone abbreviations described in RFC 822 and the system timezone, in the order named. (i.e. a definition in RFC 822 overrides the system timezone definition.) The system timezone is taken from <tt>Time.local(year, 1, 1).zone</tt> and <tt>Time.local(year, 7, 1).zone</tt>. If the extracted timezone abbreviation does not match any of them, it is ignored and the given time is regarded as a local time.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: ArgumentError is raised if Date._parse cannot extract information from <tt>date</tt> or Time class cannot represent specified date.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "This method can be used as fail-safe for other parsing methods as:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Time.rfc2822(date) rescue Time.parse(date)\n  Time.httpdate(date) rescue Time.parse(date)\n  Time.xmlschema(date) rescue Time.parse(date)\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: A failure for Time.parse should be checked, though.
