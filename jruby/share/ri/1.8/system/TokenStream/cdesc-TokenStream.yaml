  body: A TokenStream is a list of tokens, gathered during the parse of some entity (say a method). Entities populate these streams by being registered with the lexer. Any class can collect tokens by including TokenStream. From the outside, you use such an object by calling the start_collecting_tokens method, followed by calls to add_token and pop_token
